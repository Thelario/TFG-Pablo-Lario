As the title says, the main goal of the thesis is to analyzing the performance of Unity and Unity DOTS. For this purpose I created two prototypes, and for both of them I made two versions of each, one developed with normal Unity GameObjects and the other developed with Unity DOTS, and then analyzed the performance having each time more and more objects and entities in scene.
